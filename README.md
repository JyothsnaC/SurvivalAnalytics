Survival data is the data measured from a defined starting point to the occurrence of a specified 
event, for example time to diagnosis of a disease or time to failure of a machine. Often times in 
such studies the specified event does not occur before the study ends and the data thus collected 
is rarely normal and the standard statistical techniques cannot be applied directly. This paper 
primarily throws light on the non â€“ parametric models available and the model to be used when 
there are multiple factors impacting the survival time.  The primary advantage of cox 
proportional hazard model over the Kaplan Meier model is discussed using the Aids Clinical 
Trails dataset. Using the resultant hazard ratios, the impact of each covariate on time to diagnosis 
of aids is analyzed and finally cox proportional hazards model is compared with Kaplan Meier 
model.
